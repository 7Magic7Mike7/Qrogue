# Must haves #
- custom GameData location also for Linux!
- implement normal Game Mode (playing without Tutorial Stuff on generated (?) Map)
- GameSimulator: seeds need to be set correctly so random stuff like flee chance doesn't hinder execution
- consider space in backpack when buying from shop
- place collectible on the ground if you cannot pack a reward in your backpack?

# Tweaks #
- key input pauses?

# Optionals #

- use TextBox instead of BlockLabels?
- add Training-Table to SpawnRoom (implement with flee rate)
- create Rooms from file


# Ideas #
- ChallengeRooms: only use 3 gates, only 1 Hadamard, only 3 adaptions, ...

# Finished #
- raise Errors in Logger instead of arbitrary positions so we can actually log them!
