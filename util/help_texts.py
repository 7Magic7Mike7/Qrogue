            f"{_HL.special_rooms} in the Dungeon or guarded "
            f"by a {_HL.boss} - a special Enemy that wants to see a "

            f"{_HL.one_parenthesis} In the middle of the screen you see 3 {_HL.state_vectors}. The left one (Current "

            f"(Target State) is constant and depending on the "
            f"{_HL.enemy} you fight. You {_HL.win} the Fight by setting your Current State to the Target State by "
            f"adapting the mentioned Circuit. In between those two you can see their {_HL.difference}. If "
            f"it shows only {_HL.zeros} you reached your target and won the Fight!\n"
            f"{_HL.two_parenthesis} Underneath the StateVectors is your {_HL.circuit}. Currently you have 2 "
            f"{_HL.qubits} (q0, q1) and 0 out of 3 {_HL.gates} applied to them. The before mentioned Current "
            f"{_HL.state} reflects the output (out) of your {_HL.circuit}.\n"
            f"{_HL.three_parenthesis} On the bottom left you can choose the {_HL.action} you want to take: \n"
            f"{_HL.add_remove} - Change your {_HL.circuit} with the {_HL.gates} available to you (selection to the right). "
            f"After selecting a {_HL.gate} you are asked on which {_HL.qubit_s} you want to place it. If you select an "

            "together with its reward - which is usually much better than the ones from Fights. Also fleeing (or in "
            f"this case {_HL.give_up}) will always work but obviously cost you your current {_HL.attempt} which is "
