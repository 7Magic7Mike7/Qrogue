# Qrogue v0.4 #

Qrogue is a modernized Quantum Computing take of the classical game 
[Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29). 

You will play as a student who's dream is to travel through the galaxy. 
As they hear about "Mission Quniverse" they immediately apply for its 
training program to be able to join this fascinating Quantum Computing 
powered universe exploration mission.

## Installation ##


### Dependencies ###
- py_cui v0.1.4
- qiskit v0.34.2
- numpy v1.20.1
- antlr4-python3-runtime v4.10

However, these dependencies are installed automatically if you install Qrogue via pip.

### Linux/macOS ###

#### Prerequisites ####

- Python 3.8
- pip

For Linux/macOS you simply have to run 
```bash
pip install qrogue
```
to install Qrogue in your current Python environment. 

Afterwards you can launch the game simply by executing `qrogue` in the Python environment you installed Qrogue in.

### Windows ###

#### Prerequisites ####

Same as for Linux/macOS

## Notes ##

- `py_cui.errors.PyCUIOutOfBoundsError` 

Should you ever encounter this error
when starting the game please try to maximize the console you 
use for playing. This is because currently there is no automatic 
font size adaption so depending on your console settings a 
minimum width and height is required. Alternatively or if 
maximizing doesn't help you can also lower the font size of the 
console.

- newer Python versions

Usually also Python 3.9 and onward should perfectly work for 
playing Qrogue but testing is currently done for Python 3.8 so 
there is no official support yet for other versions. The same 
is true if you decide to manually install the dependencies; newer 
version will likely work but are not recommended.
