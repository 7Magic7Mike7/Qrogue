+ Room.is_in_sight()
+ GameSimulator: choose file
- GameSimulator: seeds need to be set correctly so random stuff like flee chance doesn't hinder execution
+ create config files in install-script
    + qrogue.config is created during installation
    + qrogue_game.config is created on startup if it doesn't exist

- add Training-Table to SpawnRoom (implement with flee rate)
+ adapt StateVector visualization?
- create Rooms from file
